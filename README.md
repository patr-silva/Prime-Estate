<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="about">About the project</h2>

Built with React, React Router, and Firebase, the application offers a seamless experience for users to browse property listings, view detailed information, and locate properties on an integrated map.

<h2 id="goals">Goals and objectives</h2>

This project was meant to allow me to practice creating a a full-featured web application using modern React technologies. The website allows users to create accounts, list their own properties, make offers, edit listings, and directly contact landlords. 

React Router facilitates smooth navigation between different pages, enhancing the user experience, while Firebase handles user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates.

Although the core functionalities are implemented, the project is still a work in progress. The next steps involve refining the design and styling to ensure a polished, professional look that aligns with the needs of a real estate platform.
